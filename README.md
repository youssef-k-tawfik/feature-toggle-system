# Feature Toggle System

A feature toggle system allows developers to enable or disable features in a software application without deploying new code. This helps in testing new features, rolling out updates gradually, and managing feature releases efficiently.

## Using the `mockStore` File for Tests

The `mockStore` file is used to create a mock version of the Redux store for testing purposes. This allows you to simulate different states and actions without relying on the actual store implementation.
